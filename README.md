## Project

This repository is the host to the development effort whose objective is to create automated services to further enable the CVE community in their mission.

There are many ways one can assist this project in reaching this objective.

### OSS Contributor

As a developer that wants to help contribute code to the project, getting started can be as fast as choosing an issue on our [board](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) and joining our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/cve-awg/community) to talk with developers about any questions that may come up while getting oriented with the project.

### Working Groups

The CVE project operates as several focused working groups.

The [Automation Working Group](https://cve.mitre.org/working_groups.html#awg) focuses on technical implementation and code contribution. The group meets once a week but the meetings are not mandatory and the mailing list helps to stay in the loop on development progress as meeting notes and agendas are distributed on it. It is not mandatory to become a member of the AWG in order to contribute code.

The [Quality Working Group](https://cve.mitre.org/working_groups.html#qwg) focuses on identifying areas where CVE content, rules, guidelines, and best practices must improve to better support stakeholder use cases. This is a good place to start for sharing desired functionality with the CVE project.

The [Strategic Planning Working Group](https://cve.mitre.org/working_groups.html#spwg) focuses on the long-term strategy (1-5 years) and goals of the CVE Program; works closely with the CVE Board to determine goals and objectives and will act to achieve them. If the desired functionality falls within the SPWG's range, it might be better to become a part of this working group and assist in the future of CVE.

## Contributing

Whether it be submitting an issue for a feature request or a bug report, fixing a typo on some documentation, or assisting with an issue on our GitHub board, we enthusiastically welcome any contribution. If becoming a contributor to the codebase is your goal, please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

### Security

#### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not put vulnerability information in a GitHub issue. Please consult our [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/blob/dev/SECURITY.md) for specific instructions on reporting a vulnerability that exists in the CVE Services.

## Development

### Setup

#### Using Docker

Before trying the AWG docker app, verify your docker setup is working properly using
the "Hello World" example container with the following command:

```
docker run hello-world
```

You should see a message saying "Hello from Docker!" upon success.

Then refer to the docker README found in the repo here: https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/blob/dev/docker/README.md

#### Local Development

1. Install required node modules

This assumes the latest `node` and `npm` are installed.

```sh
cd cve-services
npm install
```

2. Setup and start MongoDB locally

Install MongoDB locally

- https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

Download MongoDB Compass (MongoDB GUI)

- https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass

Create a `cve_dev` and `cve_test` database in Compass. The collections will be automatically created when the API starts storing documents.

3. Start the node application

In order to start a dev environment:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```


### Api Documentation

We have established an [openapi.yml](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/blob/dev/docs/openapi.yml) file that follows the Open API v3.0.2 specification. We are working to keep this up to date with our dev branch as we work towards our first release. We hope to use this to generate some live documentation soon along with an official project page.

<!--
ApiDoc: http://apidocjs.com/

In order to create API docs run:

```sh
    npm run docs
```

This creates an html file that can be found under apidocs/
-->

### Unit Testing

This project uses the following for unit testing

- https://mochajs.org/
- https://www.chaijs.com/

In order to run the unit tests:

```sh
npm run start:test
```
